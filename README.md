In this project I created a web API. This is a short quiz of simple coding questions. I created a start button, countdown timer, score, questions, previous and next question buttons, and stored all the data in local storage. I was able to store the scores and initials with each quiz score. I made each container disappear with each seperate page and terminate the timer along with the questions to display the users score.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

WHEN the game is over

```
